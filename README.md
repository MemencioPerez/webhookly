## ðŸ“š Introduction

webhookly is a Java dependency to send messages via discord webhooks.
The work has already been done by [k3kdude](https://github.com/k3kdude) and just been refactored.
The following example allows you to send a message to a channel.

### Motivation

[DiscordWebhook](https://gist.github.com/k3kdude/fba6f6b37594eae3d6f9475330733bdb) is currently only a gist and a single class.
This is aweful for developers and everyone who wants to use this as a dependency.
I also didn't like the code-style.
Therefore, I refactored it.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Firstly, you should add the dependency to your dependency file.
You can do this by either building it yourself **OR** (recommended) use Jitpack: https://jitpack.io/#micartey/webhookly/master-SNAPSHOT

Afterward, you can send a message as follows:

```java
DiscordWebhook webhook = new DiscordWebhook(...);
webhook.setAvatarUrl(...);
webhook.setUsername("Some Name");

EmbedObject embed = new EmbedObject()
        .setTitle("A Title")
        .setColor(new Color(174, 63 ,65))
        .setDescription("Line 1 \\n Line 2")
        .setFooter(new Footer("A Footer", ""));

webhook.getEmbeds().add(embed);
webhook.execute();
```
